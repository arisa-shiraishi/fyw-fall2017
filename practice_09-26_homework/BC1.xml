        <p><question remixerID="BC1" playID = "QU1">The children</question> assembled first, of course. School was recently over for the summer, 
            and the feeling of liberty sat uneasily on most of them; they tended to gather together quietly 
            for a while before they broke into boisterous play. and their talk was still of the classroom and 
            the teacher, of books and reprimands. Bobby Martin had already stuffed his pockets full of stones, 
            and the other boys soon followed his example, <expand remixerID="BC1" playID="EX1">selecting the smoothest and roundest stones;</expand> Bobby and 
            Harry Jones and Dickie Delacroix-- the villagers pronounced this name "Dellacroy"--eventually made a 
            great pile of stones in one corner of the square and guarded it against the raids of the other boys.
            The girls stood aside, talking among themselves, looking over their shoulders at rolled in the dust
            or clung to the hands of their older brothers or sisters.</p>
        <p><question remixerID="BC1" playID="QU2">Soon the men began to gather. surveying their own children, speaking of planting and rain, tractors 
            and taxes.</question> They stood together, away from the pile of stones in the corner, and their jokes were quiet 
            and they smiled rather than laughed. The women, wearing faded house dresses and sweaters, came shortly
            after their menfolk. They greeted one another and exchanged bits of gossip as they went to join their
            husbands. Soon the women, standing by their husbands, began to call to their children, and the children
            came reluctantly, having to be called four or five times. Bobby Martin ducked under his mother's 
            grasping hand and ran, laughing, back to the pile of stones. His father spoke up sharply, and Bobby 
            came quickly and took his place between his father and his oldest brother.</p>
        <p>The lottery was conducted--as were the square dances, the teen club, the Halloween program--by
            Mr. Summers. who had time and energy to devote to civic activities. <transform remixerID="BC1" playID="TR1">He was a round-faced, jovial
            man and he ran the coal business, and people were sorry for him. because he had no children and his
            wife was a scold.</transform> <analysis remixerID="BC1" playID="AN1">When he arrived in the square, carrying the black wooden box, there was a murmur 
            of conversation among the villagers, and he waved and called. "Little late today, folks." The postmaster,
            Mr. Graves, followed him, carrying a three- legged stool, and the stool was put in the center of the
            square and Mr. Summers set the black box down on it. The villagers kept their distance, leaving a space
            between themselves and the stool.</analysis> and when Mr. Summers said, "Some of you fellows want to give me a hand?"
            there was a hesitation before two men. Mr. Martin and his oldest son, Baxter. came forward to hold the box
            steady on the stool while Mr. Summers stirred up the papers inside it.</p>

        <analysis playREF="AN1">It is very clear that the author wanted to make the black box and its contents seem mysterious in this block
            of text.  Murmering among the villagers gives off a sketchy vibe from what could be inside the box, or perhaps they are simply
        talking amongst themselves about Mr. Summers.  The author also mentioned that the villagers "kept theit distance," adding to the mystery
        of the black wooden box.</analysis>
        <expand playREF="EX1">One of the young boys, Harry Jones, was known for being esspecially picky with his selcetion of stones.  Unlike Bobby, Harry
         had only aquired 2 stones: one was a beautifully smooth dark grey stone that was just a bit larger than his hand.  The other had a unique redish hue and
         barely fit into his pocket.</expand>
        <question playREF="QU1">Age?</question>
        <question playREF="QU2">What time period is this story set in?</question>
        <transform playREF="TR1">His wife was the nicest woman in the village and he had 3 beautiful children.  To go along with his wonderful family, Mr. Summers
        owned a coal business, which, at the time, brought in a ton of money due to coal's high demand.  The whole village was jealous of this man, but
        he did conduct the famous lottery, an exciting time for all.</transform>
