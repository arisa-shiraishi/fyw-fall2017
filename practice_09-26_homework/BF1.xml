        <p>The children assembled first, of course. School was recently over for the summer, and the feeling of liberty sat uneasily on most of them; they tended to gather together quietly for a while before they broke into boisterous play. and their talk was still of the classroom and the teacher, of books and reprimands. <analysis remixerID="#BF1" playID="B1">Bobby Martin had already stuffed his pockets full of stones, and the other boys soon followed his example, selecting the smoothest and roundest stones; Bobby and Harry Jones and Dickie Delacroix-- the villagers pronounced this name "Dellacroy"--eventually made a great pile of stones in one corner of the square and guarded it against the raids of the other boys. </analysis> The girls stood aside, talking among themselves, looking over their shoulders at rolled in the dust or clung to the hands of their older brothers or sisters.</p>
        <p>Soon the men began to gather. surveying their own children, speaking of planting and rain, tractors and taxes. They stood together, away from the pile of stones in the corner, and their jokes were quiet and they smiled rather than laughed. The women, wearing faded house dresses and sweaters, came shortly after their menfolk. They greeted one another and exchanged bits of gossip as they went to join their husbands. Soon the women, standing by their husbands, began to call to their children, and the children came reluctantly, having to be called four or five times. Bobby Martin ducked under his mother's grasping hand and ran, laughing, back to the pile of stones. His father spoke up sharply, and Bobby came quickly and took his place between his father and his oldest brother.</p>
        <p><question remixerID="BF1" playID="B2">The lottery was conducted--as were the square dances, the teen club, the Halloween program--by Mr. Summers.</question> who had time and energy to devote to civic activities. <question remixerID="BF1" playID="B3">He was a round-faced, jovial man and he ran the coal business, and people were sorry for him. because he had no children and his wife was a scold.</question> When he arrived in the square, carrying the black wooden box, there was a murmur of conversation among the villagers, and he waved and called. "Little late today, folks." <transform remixerID="BF1" playID="B4">The postmaster, Mr. Graves, followed him, carrying a three- legged stool, and the stool was put in the center of the square and Mr. Summers set the black box down on it.</transform> The villagers kept their distance, leaving a space between themselves and the stool. and when Mr. Summers said, "Some of you fellows want to give me a hand?" there was a hesitation before two men. <expand remixerID="BF1" playID="B5">Mr. Martin and his oldest son, Baxter. came forward to hold the box steady on the stool</expand> while Mr. Summers stirred up the papers inside it.</p>

        <analysis playREF="B1">Interesting commentary on human behaviour. Others follow Bobby, but also try and improve upon his design by only selecting the "best" stones. Also provides nice foreshadowing of members of this community blindly following other members.</analysis>
        <transform playREF="BF4">Suddenly, as if out of thin air, the box came to life and said "I am the box and this is my stool. Your name comes from me as the consequence of a fool." This rhyme was repeated every year, but despite its ominous and specific message, no one thought to analyze it further. </transform>
        <question playREF="B2">Is this in an effort to make The Lottery seem normal?</question>
        <question playREF="B3">Do people truly pity him for his stern wife and lack of children, or do they pity him for having to do The Lottery draw?</question>
        <expand playREF="B5">, a tradition they had maintained every year following the loss of Mr. Martin's daughter, and Baxter's sister, Candice</expand>
